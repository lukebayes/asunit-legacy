Build 3.0.1

 - Add AS 2.0 support back into the UI
 - Make storageBox persist "firstRunCompleted" so that the wizard only auto-shows once
 - Remove Launch AsUnit User Interface from UI
 - Remove escape key listener that closes the UI, the interface should be kept open
 	and so closing shouldn't be so easy to do accidentally
 - Make default class path selectable text in wizard
 - Make addInterface select the newly added interface - even if it already exists in the list.
 - Update Finder so that key commands make more sense...
 	a) Any Typing should always be entered in the text field and thereby narrow the list
 		Regardless of the focused element.
 	b) Pressing enter should always leave with selected (or topmost?) item
 	c) Arrows up/down should always choose different items in list
 	d) Mouse selection should be allowed, but typing will return focus to the filter entry
 - Update Finder so that you can select the first item in the list
 - Fix superclass textfield listener so that you can type in there
 	Made the listener wait a full second before selecting the field.
 - Make first page of wizard not highlight all text
 - Add button to Generate Test Suites without creating a new class
 - Build Wizard interface for introductions
 - Make interface list disallow empty items
 - Update interface listbox so that next item is selected after an
 	item is removed
