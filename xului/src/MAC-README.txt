
1) Download the mac release of xulrunner from:
http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/XULRunner

2) Unpack dmg archive from here into a new 
folder named "xulrunner", so that this directory
looks like:

.svn/
chrome/
defaults/
xulrunner/xulrunner(binary)
application.ini
build.sh
install.rdf
TODO.txt
MAC-README.txt

3) Using a terminal in this directory, execute:
. xulrunner/xulrunner application.ini

This should launch the AsUnit XULUI. You should 
be able to create some kind of simlink or shortcut 
to this action, but I'm not sure how that's done 
on Mac - if you know, please send me a brief 
description so that I can update this doc!

If you know how to create an executable binary for OSX,
please contact us asap as we need your help!


Thanks,
