
------------------------------------------------
Version 2.8
------------------------------------------------
 - Cleaned up Mac integration for mxp


------------------------------------------------
Version 2.7
------------------------------------------------
 - Go to http://lukebayes.blogspot.com for detailed installation instructions
 - Added Completely new XUL based UI!
 - Fixed warnings in MTASC compiler (once and for all)
 - Updated TestSuite Template so that TestSuites work in MTASC
 - Updated Assert.as so that MTASC doesn't complain
 - Updated LocalConnServer so that MTASC doesn't complain
 - Fixed bug in createTextField. Method now returns an instance of
   	the newly-created TextField object. The FMX2K4 intrinsic method of
       	the same name returned void, so return _root.createTextField was not
	working!
 - Added JavaDoc comments to source code from Kristopher Schultz
 - Updated Assert.assertEquals to try to fix a casting issue with
 	MTASC
 - Added createEmptyMovieClip and getNextHighestDepth helper methods.
 	These will help developers work more easily with their
 	TestCases that operate on MovieClip entities.
 - Added delay to the LocalConnection so that it now groups requests
 	before sending them. This makes the environment MUCH more
 	responsive - especially when executing many many tests.
 	Special thanks to Robert Penner for suggesting this feature
 	and another thanks goes to the osflash.org list for their
 	VERY informative discussion about LocalConnection size
 	limits (this was incredibly frustrating!)
 - Added "cleanUp" method that gets executed after all test methods
 	are executed. This should allow us to clean up member / global
 	vars that are created during async TestCases.
 - Added note to Build Test Suites.jsfl to clarify "ignoreDirs" param.
 - Updated Create Class.jsfl to work with versions of Flash that are
 	more recent than 7.2...
 - Updated TestCase.cleanUp method to remove the Void argument as that
 	was causing problems in MTASC when using the -strict flag.

------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.4 May 27, 2004
------------------------------------------------
 - Removed Unused import statements in order to make less noise when
 	compiling in verbose mode in MTASC
 - Updated the version number to *really* include the 3rd value (revisions)
 - Updated the version checker to send the current version to the server
 	for usage tracking.
 - Updated the actual version number found in Main.as
 - Made minor changes to assertEquals according to submission
 	from Robert Penner
 - Added _SVN directories to ignore list for "Create Test Suites" command
 	as per request from Gabe Varela

------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6.rc2 May 24, 2005
------------------------------------------------
 - Fixed bug injected in RC1 where the Local Connection was
 	showing "undefined" for all failing test data.

------------------------------------------------
Version 2.6 May 24, 2005
------------------------------------------------
 - Implemented full MTASC support thanks to:
	Ralf Bokelberg, Erixtekila, and Daniel Wabyick
 - Added com.asunit.util.TextFile object for simpler
 	loading of external files during unit testing.
 - Added Eclipse directory names to the ignore list for the
 	Build Test Suites command so that it will no longer include
 	those directories in the TestSuite.
 - Fixed assertEquals method in TestCase according to Keith Peters' comments
 - Fixed problem with setCurrentMethod according to Caleb's post so that
 	assertion failures will be accurate even when using
 	asynchronous test cases.

------------------------------------------------
Version 2.5 January 8, 2005
------------------------------------------------
 - Implemented AsUnit for Flex. After manual user installation, the .as
 	files will now compile and communicate correctly.
 - Added underscore prefix so that Sys.println and Unit Tests are now
 	cross-domain compatible.
 - Updated TestCase.attachMovie to support optional arguments.
 - Added the TestCaseXml object and integrated into the TestCase.
 - Fixed asynch test bug where failures were reporting invalid classname
 	as source class.
 - Fixed LocalConnections in UI so that they close onUnload
 - Added optional Sys.println output to AsUnit UI which also supports
 	cross-session memory of user selection.
 - Removed extraneous output from Failed Assertions.
 - Fixed "Add to Library" so that it will also make the new Class extend
 	MovieClip.

------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4 November 29, 2004
------------------------------------------------
 - Added links to screenshots to the README.txt file.
 	(special thanks to Erixtikela)

------------------------------------------------
Version 2.4 November 17, 2004
------------------------------------------------
 - Clicking a failing test in the AsUnit UI no longer throws a JSFL error
 	on Mac (This feature removed from Mac version.)
 - Clicking a failing test in the AsUnit UI will now respect your
 	"Text Editor" setting from the Create Class Command on Windows.
 	(requires restart of IDE if this value changes)
 - Create Class no longer crashes when Auto-Opening a file
 - Added Flash IDE revision check so that Create Class no longer fails
 	mysteriously on < 7.2
 - Create Class no longer locks up on the mac.

------------------------------------------------
Version 2.3 November 17, 2004
------------------------------------------------
 - Worked around the "Flash locking up" bug caused when running CreateClass
   with a panel undocked and using the Flash IDE as a text editor by updating
   CreateClass to explicitly handle the Flash IDE as a text editor

------------------------------------------------
Version 2.2 November 16, 2004
------------------------------------------------
 - Updated TestCase so that it's easier to build asynchronous tests.
 - Added static fail method to Assert so that you can put Assertions directly
   into your applications.
 - Updated the TestClassTemplate so that it now uses "instance" rather than
   "testInstance"
 - Updated TestCase so that it now has a streamlined "attachMovie" method that
   only requires "linkageId" and "initObj"
 - Updated the Quickstart Guide to include MovieClip support!
 - Updated CreateClass so that it should now work again on Macs!!!
 	(SPECIAL THANKS TO : erixtekila of ifrance.com!!!)

------------------------------------------------
Version 2.1 October 23, 2004
------------------------------------------------
 - Updated the DLL so that Windows Users can click on a Failed Test and have
   the .as file open in whatever application they have associated with the .as
   mimetype.
 - Updated the Version Check so that it really does work now.

------------------------------------------------
Version 2.0 October 23, 2004
------------------------------------------------
- Updated the AsUnit UI so that failed tests will include a link to the failing
  test case. When clicked, this link will open the TestCase in the Flash IDE.
  (works - but want to later implement opening in the IDE of your choice!)
- Added "Sys.getFileSeparator" to the Sys object. Will return the appropriate
  file separator for current operating system. ("\", ":", "/")... Should be
  tested on Mac and Linux...
- Updated the README to walk users through an example quickstart demo.
- Added "Update Test Suites" to the Create Class Command, so that users don't
  have to remember to execute that command after each creation.
- Implemented the LocalOutputPanel so that users can view Sys.println
  statements without the Flash IDE Open.

  To Implement, simply put the following somewhere on your main timeline:

    import com.asunit.controls.*;
    var locOutpup:LocalOutputPanel = LocalOutputPanel.getInstance(this, 10000);

- Fixed "auto-open" for Mac users. *NOTE: This will "only" open the file in the
  Flash IDE.
- Overload of assert-methods, i.e. msg is now optional
- Strict equality is used where needed
- Updated the Create Class, TestCase and TestSuite Templates so that they are
  now pulled directly from human-readable files, users can now make their class
  and TestClass templates look however they want. (For example, you can change
  linkageId to symbolName and classRef to symbolOwner in the New Class
  Template)
- Moved installed files from "External Libraries" to "External
  Libraries/asunit" to keep user installation directories clean.
- Changed OS check from looking for "C:" drive to looking at fl.version
  property.
- Updated FileSystem Check so that a TestCase will still be written even if the
  Class Under Test already exists.
